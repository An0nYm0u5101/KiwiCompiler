Source Code Encryption Tool [KiwiCompiler] is a Native source code encryption tool for Internet companies and individual developers. Similar to a normal compiler, it can compile C, C++, Objective-C, Swift and other source code into binary; however, the difference is that the security compiler can perform three security processing on the code when compiling: 1. logical confusion, deformation, expansion. 2.function call relationship encryption. 3. sensitive strings encryption. With the help of those features, the source code security will be greatly improved, preventing the attacker from decompiling the binary code through the reverse tool such as IDA Pro to tamper or steal the core technology.
 
## Features and Advantages
* **Code Obfuscation:** Protect code from expansion, confusion. To prevent reverse analysis by IDA Pro.
* **String Encryption:** Encryption of sensitive strings to prevent attackers from locating core code through keywords.
* **Multi-Language:** Support for obfuscation protection of C, C++, Objective-C, Swift codes.
* **Easy to Use:** Android studio plug-in mode, the same as the original compilation process.
